## Project summary:

We have developed a new framework to quantify the degree of uncertainty and skewness related to field observations of Vs30, a geophysical parameter that can help predict the ground motion during an earthquake. The premise of the framework is that the distribution of Vs30 measurements can be theoretically approximated by a reciprocal-normal distribution, which is a skewed distribution. This implies that the mode should be used as the characteristic value of Vs30 measurements, as opposed to the mean or median.
